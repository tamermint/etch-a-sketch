# Etch-a-sketch
This repo will be primarily used to practice and flex DOM manipulation skills. This is in line with Odin-Project's Etch-A-Sketch assignment and it will be a webpage with 16 * 16 grid of square divs

# Basic methods used
- CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Vanilla Javascipt
- HTML

# Instructions
 - Use the slider to generate a grid i.e. for 16 you will get 16 * 16, for 20 you will get 20 * 20 grid etc.

 - Condition : the total space for the pad doesn't change so if you want 60/side(60 is the maximum :), you will see really small squares

 - Pick ypu color - lets you pick the color from the palette

 - Randomizer - puts random color in the grid 

 - Add Some Grey - will keep adding gray to cells and after 10 mouse drags the cells will be totally black

 - Erase - to erase the grid

 - Etch your heart out!
