# Etch-a-sketch
This repo will be primarily used to practice and flex DOM manipulation skills. This is in line with Odin-Project's Etch-A-Sketch assignment and it will be a webpage with 16 * 16 grid of square divs

# Basic methods used
CSS Flexbox and Grid
Vanilla Javascipt
HTML

# Instructions
 - Click on the new pad link to generate a prompt to ask how many squares per side
 you would like

 - Condition : the total space for the pad doesn't change so if you want 100/side, you will
 see really small squares

 - Etch your heart out!
